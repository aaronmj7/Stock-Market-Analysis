# Stock-Market-Analysis

Assignment Tasks:

In this assignment, you will delve into the world of stock market prediction and financial analysis using Keras. You are required to:

Analysis of Stock Data:  Understand the peculiarities of stock data, such as seasonality, volatility, and its non-stationary nature.
Application of Keras: Discuss how Keras can be leveraged to process and analyze stock data. This includes data preprocessing, training, and forecasting.
Select a specific company's stock or a general stock index,  from Yahoo! Finance's API,  using yfinanceLinks to an external site.. Your emphasis should be on the critical evaluation of the role that Keras and deep learning play in stock prediction, and this should be backed by a review of relevant scientific literature.

Your Submission Should:

Describe at least one specific model architecture in Keras used for stock analysis.
Highlight any preprocessing techniques applied to the stock data before feeding it into the model.
Consider potential economic, technological, and ethical implications of using AI for stock predictions.
For Your Submission, You Should Create:

Slide Presentation:

Construct a 10-page slide presentation detailing your findings.
The slides should cover:
Introduction to the chosen stock/company.
A brief overview of LSTMs and their suitability for stock data.
Preprocessing techniques employed.
The LSTM architecture and parameters chosen.
Results and predictions from the model.
Limitations and potential areas of improvement.
Colab Notebook:

Create a Google ColabLinks to an external site. notebook that contains all the code used for your analysis.
The notebook should be well-commented, ensuring that steps are clear and replicable.
Include sections for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, prediction, and evaluation.
Ensure the notebook can be executed seamlessly from start to finish.
